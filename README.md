🔭 I’m currently working on **Quiz Application Frontend**  
📂 [Project Repo](https://github.com/felixxplore/Quiz-Application)

🤝 I’m looking to connect with **backend-focused dev communities** to discuss topics like scalable architecture, Java security practices, and microservices design.

🌱 I’m currently learning **Docker** for better DevOps and deployment practices.

💬 I believe in continuous learning and currently leveling up my skills in **Java, Spring Boot, and scalable architecture**.
